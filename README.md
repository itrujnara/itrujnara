# üß¨ Bioinformatics
I'm currently studying bioinformatics at [Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://upf.edu). I'm working on my final project under supervision of [Cedric Notredame](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1461-0988).

My final project and related code. Some highlights:

# üéÆ Game Development
I create indie video games in [Unreal Engine 5](https://unrealengine.com) under the name Vistula Development.

The video game [Track Racer](https://instagram.com/trackracergame). Early access expected in late 2024.
